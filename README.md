# stock-analysis
##Over view
The purpose of this project was to make an efficient way to look at multiple stocks using VBA. 
After being able to run the analysis of these 12 different stocks the first, 
it was apparent that there was a more efficient way to work with the data given. In order to make the analysis more efficient, 
I needed to refactor my code. This project looks to see if my refactoring made the analysis more efficient.

1.The major advantage of refactoring code in VBA script is that you can use as much as of the original code as you want to and can put your new code side by side with your old code using different modules. The major disadvantage of refactoring code in VBA script is that if you do not have a strong understanding of the syntax, you will struggle to refactor your code as the syntax matters so much more when trying to make your code more efficient.

2. The major advantage of refactoring code is making the code more efficient. The major disadvantage of refactoring code is that you are taking code that already works and potential making it unusable if you can refactor it correctly. For that reason it is always smart to save your original code just incase you end up not being able to refactor it.
